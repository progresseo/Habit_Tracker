# Habit_Tracker
 Recording my journey to complete this first project! 

 > I had already installed Visual Studio, GitDesktop, made a github profile. 
 > Created a new project in VS and comitted it. 
 > Install SQLite and created a db. Got confused between .db and .sqppro files. This was because I was clicking on save project after creating and editing the database. Saving a project creates a .sqppro. This took me a while to figure out. Just press ctrl+s to save and close database, don't click save project.
 
 > Pasted the code from csharacademy. Got lots of errors! Got very confused. 
  > Followed youtube tutorial on how to make a SQLite connection. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APVit-pynwQ&ab_channel=DevNami
  Managed to install a Nuget Package. Realised that I have to pull in the SQLite library by adding using at the top. 
 > Still got the errors. 
 > Copied code from the tutorial realised the spelling of the class was different. 
 > Realised I had downloaded a different Nuget package to the Microsoft one. Went back and installed that. So now I am using the intended nuget package for this project. 

 >getting error that connection is not opening so going to just follow the youtube tutorial to make the connection instead. Using a System.Data.SQLite nuget package
 >Managed to add entry to  the database
 >getting errors when trying to delete a specific entry

 > Had installed the professional version of Visual Studio, trial ran out so had to uninstall and install the community version. 
 >Came back from a break from coding; getting distracted by the fact that I can't find documentation for System.Data.SQLite, can't really understand microsoft documentation so trying to focus on actually doing what I need to do for the porject

 >Deleting specific entry worked. Make sure the user input is set properly. 
 >Managed to get all the CRUD fucntions working. 
 > Need to put then in classes so I can link it to the main menu.
