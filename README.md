# Habit_Tracker
 Recording my journey to complete this first project! 

 > I had already installed Visual Studio, GitDesktop, made a github profile. 

 > Created a new project in VS and comitted it. 

  > Install SQLite and created a db. Got confused between .db and .sqppro files. This was because I was clicking on save project after creating and editing the database. Saving a project creates a .sqppro. This took me a while to figure out. Just press ctrl+s to save and close database, don't click save project.
 
  >For the porject a database is created from VS so no need to create separate .db file. 


 > Pasted the code from csharacademy. Got lots of errors! Got very confused. 
 
 > Followed youtube tutorial on how to make a SQLite connection. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APVit-pynwQ&ab_channel=DevNami
 
 > Managed to install a Nuget Package. Realised that I have to pull in the SQLite library by adding using at the top. 
 
 > Still got the errors. 

 > Copied code from the tutorial realised the spelling of the class was different. 

 > Realised I had downloaded a different Nuget package to the Microsoft one. Went back and installed that. So now I am using the intended nuget package for this project. 

 
 >getting error that connection is not opening so going to just follow the youtube tutorial to make the connection instead. Using a System.Data.SQLite nuget package
 
 >Managed to add entry to  the database
 
 >getting errors when trying to delete a specific entry

 
 >Shows CRUD

 > Had installed the professional version of Visual Studio, trial ran out so had to uninstall and install the community version. 
 
 >Came back from a break from coding; getting distracted by the fact that I can't find documentation for System.Data.SQLite, can't really understand microsoft documentation so trying to focus on actually doing what I need to do for the porject

 >Deleting specific entry worked. Make sure the user input is set properly. 
 
 >Managed to get all the CRUD fucntions working. 
 
 > Need to put them in methods so I can link it to the main menu.
 
 >Methods tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkDroqxS8LY
 
 >Then just used the errors to guide me. Have to open and close connections in each method.

>Create a menu using switch statement. https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_switch.php 

>Updated the show all method so it displays the column headers as well.

>Updated the columns to be named date and quantity

>Use a while loop in the menu to make sure the menu comes back after selecting each method, so you can do multiple things in the app without having to restart it. 

>Not sure where to start with data validation

>Searched for videos on data validation

> Used tryparse and if function to validate quantity input

>Looking into validating the date input using TryParseExact.

> To ensure there aren't any duplicate entries, you can use SQL Unique constraint. It stops the duplicate entry but it does crash the app.

> To stop the crash and deal with the exception use Try {} catch{}. If there is a duplicate entry it gives you a message to tell you what the error is and then takes you to the beginning to try again instaed of crashing the app.

>More validation- what if the record to delete or update doesn't exist - need a message!
>There is dead end when I delete a record after I enter a date that doesn't exist.
