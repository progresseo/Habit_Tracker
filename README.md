# Habit_Tracker
 Recording my journey to complete this first project! 

 > I had already installed Visual Studio, GitDesktop, made a github profile. 
 > Created a new project in VS and comitted it. 
 > Install SQLite and created a db. Got confused between .db and .sqppro files. This was because I was clicking on save project after creating and editing the database. Saving a project creates a .sqppro. This took me a while to figure out. Just press ctrl+s to save and close database, don't click save project.
 
 > Pasted the code from csharacademy. Got lots of errors! Got very confused. 
  > Followed youtube tutorial on how to make a SQLite connection. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APVit-pynwQ&ab_channel=DevNami
  Managed to install a Nuget Package. Realised that I have to pull in the SQLite library by adding using at the top. 
 > Still got the errors. 
 > Copied code from the tutorial realised the spelling of the class was different. 
 > Realised I had downloaded a different Nuget package to the Microsoft one. When back and installed that. So now I am using the intended nuget package for this project. 

 >getting error that connection is not opening so going to just follow the youtube tutorial to make the connection instead. Using a System.Data.SQLite nuget package
 >Managed to add entry to  the database
 getting errors when trying to delete a specific entry
